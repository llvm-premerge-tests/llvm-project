Execution Results Handling in Clang-REPL
=========================================

Execution Results Handling features discussed below help extend the Clang-REPL 
functionality by creating an interface between the execution results of a 
program and the compiled program.

- The Automatic Printf feature makes it easy to display variable values 
  during program execution.

- The Value Synthesis feature helps store the execution results 
  (to be able to bring them back to the compiled program).

- The Pretty Printing feature helps create a temporary dump to display the value
  and type (pretty print) of the desired data. 

1. Automatic Printf
===================

The `Automatic Printf` feature makes it easy to display variable values during 
program execution. Using the `printf` function repeatedly is not required. 
This is achieved using an extension in the `libclangInterpreter` library.

To automatically print the value of an expression, simply write the expression 
in the global scope **without a semicolon**.

Examples
--------
.. code-block:: console

    clang-repl> int x = 42;
    clang-repl> x       // equivalent to calling printf("(int &) %d\n", x);
    (int &) 42

    clang-repl> std::vector<int> v = {1,2,3};
    clang-repl> v  // This syntax is fine after D127284 
    (std::vector<int> &) {1,2,3}

    clang-repl> "Hello, interactive C++!"
    (const char [24]) "Hello, interactive C++!"

Significance of this feature
----------------------------

Inspired by a similar implementation in `Cling <https://github.com/root-project/cling>`_,
this feature added to upstream Clang repo has essentially extended the syntax of
C++,so that it can be more helpful for people that are writing code for data 
science applications.
 
This is useful, for example, when you want to experiment with a set of values 
against a set of functions, and you'd like to know the results right away. 
This is similar to how Python works (hence its popularity in data science 
research), but the superior performance of C++, along with this flexibility 
makes it a more attractive option.

Annotation Token (annot_repl_input_end)
---------------------------------------

This feature uses a new token (annot_repl_input_end) to consider printing the 
value of an expression if it doesn't end with a semicolon. When parsing an 
Expression Statement, if the last semicolon is missing, then the code will 
pretend that there one and set a marker there for later utilization, and 
continue parsing.

A semicolon is normally required in C++, but this feature expands the C++ 
syntax to handle cases where a missing semicolon is expected (i.e., when 
handling an expression statement). It also makes sure that an error is not 
generated for the missing semicolon in this specific case. 

This is accomplished by identifying the end position of the user input 
(expression statement). This helps store and return the expression statement 
effectively, so that it can be printed (displayed to the user automatically).

**Note:** This logic is only available for C++ for now, since part of the 
implementation itself requires C++ features. Future versions may support more 
languages.

.. code-block:: console

  Token *CurTok = nullptr;
  // If the semicolon is missing at the end of REPL input, consider if
  // we want to do value printing. Note this is only enabled in C++ mode
  // since part of the implementation requires C++ language features.
  // Note we shouldn't eat the token since the callback needs it.
  if (Tok.is(tok::annot_repl_input_end) && Actions.getLangOpts().CPlusPlus)
    CurTok = &Tok;
  else
    // Otherwise, eat the semicolon.
    ExpectAndConsumeSemi(diag::err_expected_semi_after_expr);

  StmtResult R = handleExprStmt(Expr, StmtCtx);
  if (CurTok && !R.isInvalid())
    CurTok->setAnnotationValue(R.get());

  return R;
    }

AST Transformation
-------------------

When Sema encounters the `annot_repl_input_end` token, it knows to transform 
the AST before the real CodeGen process. It will consume the token and set a 
'semi missing' bit in the respective decl.

.. code-block:: console

    if (Tok.is(tok::annot_repl_input_end) &&
        Tok.getAnnotationValue() != nullptr) {
        ConsumeAnnotationToken();
        cast<TopLevelStmtDecl>(DeclsInGroup.back())->setSemiMissing();
    }

In the AST Consumer, traverse all the Top Level Decls, to look for expressions 
to synthesize. If the current Decl is the Top Level Statement 
Decl(`TopLevelStmtDecl`) and has a semicolon missing, then ask the interpreter 
to synthesize another expression (an internal function call) to replace this 
original expression.

2. 'Value' Synthesis
====================

In many cases, it is useful to bring back the program execution result to the 
compiled program. This result can be stored in an object of type **Value**.

Incremental AST Consumer
-------------------------

The `IncrementalASTConsumer` class wraps the original code generator 
`ASTConsumer` and it performs a hook, to traverse all the top-level decls, to 
look for expressions to synthesize, based on the `isSemiMissing()` condition.

If this condition is found to be true, then `Interp.SynthesizeExpr()` will be 
invoked. 

.. code-block:: console

    for (Decl *D : DGR)
      if (auto *TSD = llvm::dyn_cast<TopLevelStmtDecl>(D);
          TSD && TSD->isSemiMissing())
        TSD->setStmt(Interp.SynthesizeExpr(cast<Expr>(TSD->getStmt())));

    return Consumer->HandleTopLevelDecl(DGR);

The synthesizer will then choose the relevant expression, based on its type.

How Execution Results are captured:
-----------------------------------

The synthesizer chooses which expression to synthesize, and then it replaces 
the original expression with the synthesized expression. Depending on the 
expression type, it may choose to save an object (`LastValue`) of type 'value'
while allocating memory to it (`SetValueWithAlloc()`), or not (
`SetValueNoAlloc()`).

.. image:: valuesynth.png
   :align: center
   :alt: valuesynth design

Where is the captured result stored?
------------------------------------

`LastValue` holds the last result of the value printing. It is a class member 
because it can be accessed even after subsequent inputs. 

**Note:** If no value printing happens, then it is in an invalid state. 

Interpreter as a REPL vs. as a Library
---------------------------------------

1 - If we're using the interpreter in interactive (REPL) mode, it will dump 
the value (i.e., value printing).

.. code-block:: console

  if (LastValue.isValid()) {
    if (!V) {
      LastValue.dump();
      LastValue.clear();
    } else
      *V = std::move(LastValue);
  }


2 - If we're using the interpreter as a library, then it will pass the value 
to the user.

Improving Efficiency and User Experience
-----------------------------------------

The Value object is essentially used to create a mapping between an expression 
'type' and the 'memory' to be allocated. Built-in types (bool, char, int, 
float, double, etc.) are simpler, since their memory allocation size is known. 
In case of objects, a pointer can be saved, since the size of the object is 
not known.

For further improvement, the underlying Clang Type is also identified. For 
example, `X(char, Char_S)`, where `Char_S` is the Clang type. Clang types are 
very efficient, which is important since these will be used in hotspots (high 
utilization areas of the program). The `Value.h` header file has a very low 
token count and was developed with strict constraints in mind, since it can 
affect the performance of the interpreter.

This also enables the user to receive the computed 'type' back in their code 
and then transform the type into something else (e.g., transform a double into 
a float). Normally, the compiler can handle these conversions transparently, 
but in interpreter mode, the compiler cannot see all the 'from' and 'to' types,
so it cannot implicitly do the conversions. So this logic enables providing 
these conversions on request. 

On-request conversions can help improve the user experience, by allowing 
conversion to a desired 'to' type, when the 'from' type is unknown or unclear

Significance of this Feature
-----------------------------

The 'Value' object enables wrapping a memory region that comes from the 
JIT, and bringing it back to the compiled code (and vice versa). 
This is a very useful functionality when:

- connecting an interpreter to the compiled code, or
- connecting an interpreter in another language.

For example, the `CPPYY` code makes use of this feature to enable running 
C++ within Python. It enables transporting values/information between C++ 
and Python.

In a nutshell, this feature enables a new way of developing code, paving the 
way for language interoperability and easier interactive programming.

Communication between Compiled Code and Interpreted Code
--------------------------------------------------------

In Clang-REPL there is **interpreted code**, and this feature adds a 'value' 
runtime that can talk to the **compiled code**.

Following is an example where the compiled code interacts with the interpreter 
code. The execution results of an expression are stored in the object 'V' of 
type Value. This value is then printed, effectively helping the interpreter 
use a value from the compiled code.

.. code-block:: console

    int Global = 42;
    void setGlobal(int val) { Global = val; }
    int getGlobal() { return Global; }
    Interp.ParseAndExecute(“void setGlobal(int val);”);
    Interp.ParseAndExecute(“int getGlobal();”);
    Value V;
    Interp.ParseAndExecute(“getGlobal()”, &V);
    std::cout << V.getAs<int>() << “\n”; // Prints 42


**Note:** Above is an example of interoperability between the compiled code and 
the interpreted code. Interoperability between languages (e.g., C++ and Python) 
works similarly.

3. Pretty Printing
===================

This feature helps create a temporary dump to display the value and type 
(pretty print) of the desired data. This is a good way to interact with the 
interpreter during interactive programming.

How it works
---------------
.. image:: prettyprint.png
   :align: center
   :alt: prettyprint design

Parsing mechanism:
------------------

The Interpreter in Clang-REPL (`interpreter.cpp`) includes the function 
`ParseAndExecute()` that can accept a 'Value' parameter to capture the result. 
But if the value parameter is made optional and it is omitted (i.e., that the 
user does not want to utilize it elsewhere), then the last value can be 
validated and pushed into the `dump()` function. 

**Note:** Following is a sample code snippet. Actual code may vary over time.

.. code-block:: console

    llvm::Error Interpreter::ParseAndExecute(llvm::StringRef Code, Value *V) {

    auto PTU = Parse(Code);
    if (!PTU)
        return PTU.takeError();
    if (PTU->TheModule)
        if (llvm::Error Err = Execute(*PTU))
        return Err;

    if (LastValue.isValid()) {
        if (!V) {
        LastValue.dump();
        LastValue.clear();
        } else
        *V = std::move(LastValue);
    }
    return llvm::Error::success();
    }

The `dump()` function (in `value.cpp`) calls the `print()` function.

.. code-block:: console

    void Value::print(llvm::raw_ostream &Out) const {
    assert(OpaqueType != nullptr && "Can't print default Value");

    if (getType()->isVoidType() || !isValid())
        return;

    std::string Str;
    llvm::raw_string_ostream SS(Str);

    //Print the Type and Data
    
    SS << "(";
    printType(SS);
    SS << ") ";
    printData(SS);
    SS << "\n";
    Out << Str;
    }

Printing the Data and Type are handled in their respective functions: 
`ReplPrintDataImpl()` and `ReplPrintTypeImpl()`.
