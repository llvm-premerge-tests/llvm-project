Overview
========

This document contains the status of the Library Fundamentals TS v3 (LFTSv3) in libc++.
It is used to track both the status of the sub-projects and who is assigned to
these sub-projects. This is imperative to effective implementation so that work
is not duplicated and implementors are not blocked by each other.

If you are interested in contributing to the libc++ LFTSv3, please send
a message to the #libcxx channel in the LLVM discord. Please *do not* start
working on any of the assigned items below.
